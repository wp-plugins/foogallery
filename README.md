FooGallery
==========

The Most Intuitive and Extensible Gallery Creation and Management Tool Ever Created for WordPress. Built to be simple for users and highly flexible for developers.

###Description

Our #1 goal with FooGallery was to utilize as much of the core image and gallery handling functionality that is already built into WordPress as possible.
The result is an intuitive gallery creation and management experience with the added benefit of the powerful features that FooGalley includes.

FooGallery was designed to be the most developer-friendly gallery plugin available for WordPress.
It was also built on top of a solid extension framework, which means different functionality is separated out into different areas in the codebase.
It also means the core plugin is lightweight, but still allowing for the most flexibility.
