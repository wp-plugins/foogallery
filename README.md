Foo Gallery is the most intuitive and extensible gallery management tool ever created for WordPress. Now with albums!

## Description ##

Foo Gallery allows for better image gallery management within WordPress. Built to be simple for users and highly flexible for developers.

Our #1 goal with Foo Gallery was to utilize as much of the core image handling functionality that already exists in WordPress.

The result is an intuitive gallery creation and management experience that is easy to use and lightweight and fast.

FooGallery was designed to be the most developer-friendly gallery plugin available for WordPress. It was also built on top of a solid extension framework, which means different functionality is separated out into different areas in the codebase. It also means the core plugin is lightweight, but still allowing for the most flexibility.
